.SH NAME
m2s \- modify files by randomly changing bits

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B m2s
[<options>]
[<x86_binary> [<arg_list>]]
.P
The user command-line supports a sequence of command-line options, and can
include an x86 ELF binary (executable x86 program) followed by its arguments.
The execution of this program will be simulated by Multi2Sim, together with the
rest of the x86 programs specified in the context configuration file (option
'--ctx-config <file>'). The rest of the possible command-line options are
classified in categories and listed next:

variables. Type 'm2s \-\-ctx-config\-help' for a description of the file
format.

.TP

Show a help message describing the format of the context configuration
file, passed to the simulator through option '\-\-ctx\-config <file>'.

.TP
.BR \-\-elf\-debug\ <file>

Generate a trace file with debug information on the configuration of the
modeled CPUs, GPUs, and memory system, as well as their dynamic

should watch the size of the generated trace as simulation runs, since
the trace file can quickly become extremely large.
