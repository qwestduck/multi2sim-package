Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, libgtk-3, freeglut3, libglew, llvm-3.1
Description: CPU-GPU Simulator for Heterogeneous Computing
 Multi2Sim is a simulation framework for CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing written
 in C. It includes models for superscalar, multithreaded, and multicore CPUs,
 as well as GPU architectures.

Package: libm2s-cuda1
Section: universe/libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends} 
Description: Multi2Sim CUDA runtime
 Provides a shared CUDA runtime for use with Multi2Sim. This allows
 simulation of cuda environments on Multi2Sim without needing a 
 vendor driver.

Package: libm2s-cuda1-dev
Section: universe/libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, libm2s-cuda1 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Multi2sim CUDA runtime - development library
 Provides a shared CUDA runtime for use with Multi2Sim. This allows
 simulation of cuda environments on Multi2Sim without needing a
 vendor driver.
 .
 This package provides symlinks for libm2s-cuda1.so.1.0.0 for convenient
 linking.

Package: libm2s-glew1
Section: universe/libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Multi2Sim OpenGL Extension Wrangler
 The OpenGL Extension Wrangler, GLEW for short, is a library that
 handles initialization of OpenGL extensions in a portable and simple
 way.  Once the program initializes the library and checks the
 availability of extensions, it can safely call the entry points defined
 by the extension.

Package: libm2s-glu1
Section: universe/libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Multi2Sim OpenGL utility library
 GLU offers simple interfaces for building mipmaps; checking for the
 presence of extensions in the OpenGL (or other libraries which follow
 the same conventions for advertising extensions); drawing
 piecewise-linear curves, NURBS, quadrics and other primitives
 (including, but not limited to, teapots); tesselating surfaces; setting
 up projection matrices and unprojecting screen coordinates to world
 coordinates.
