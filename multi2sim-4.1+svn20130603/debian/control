Description: CPU-GPU Simulator for Heterogeneous Computing
 Multi2Sim is a simulation framework for CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing written
 in C. It includes models for superscalar, multithreaded, and multicore CPUs,
 as well as GPU architectures.

Package: libm2s-cuda1
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Pre-Depends: multiarch-support 
Description: Multi2Sim CUDA runtime
 Provides a shared CUDA runtime for use with Multi2Sim. This allows
 simulation of cuda environments on Multi2Sim without needing a 
 vendor driver.

Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, libm2s-cuda1 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Multi2sim CUDA runtime - development library
 Provides a shared CUDA runtime for use with Multi2Sim. This allows
 simulation of cuda environments on Multi2Sim without needing a
 vendor driver.

Description: Multi2Sim OpenGL Extension Wrangler
 The OpenGL Extension Wrangler, GLEW for short, is a library that
 handles initialization of OpenGL extensions in a portable and simple
 way.  Once the program initializes the library and checks the
 availability of extensions, it can safely call the entry points defined
 by the extension.

Pre-Depends: multiarch-support
Description: Multi2Sim OpenGL utility library
 GLU offers simple interfaces for building mipmaps; checking for the
 presence of extensions in the OpenGL (or other libraries which follow
 the same conventions for advertising extensions); drawing
 piecewise-linear curves, NURBS, quadrics and other primitives
 (including, but not limited to, teapots); tesselating surfaces; setting
 up projection matrices and unprojecting screen coordinates to world
 coordinates.

Description: Multi2Sim OpenGL Utility Toolkit
 GLUT is a window system independent toolkit for writing OpenGL programs,
 implementing a simple windowing API, which makes learning about and
 exploring OpenGL programming very easy.
 .
 GLUT is designed for constructing small to medium sized OpenGL programs,
 however it is not a full-featured toolkit, so large applications requiring
 sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window system
 toolkits like GTK+ or Motif.
